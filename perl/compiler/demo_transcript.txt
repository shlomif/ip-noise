Before:
-------

1. Prepare an xterm on Desktop 5. 
   cd it into ~/Docs/Univ/cvs/perl/scripts/test/udp and run 
   perl server.pl.

1.1: Prepare a root xterm running "tail -f /var/log/messages"

2. Log in on comnet17/18 and open several xterms.

3. On comnet 17/18, ssh into vipe twice. (/usr/local/bin/ssh)

4. On comnet 17/18, ssh into t2.

5. On comnet17/18, open a netscape window with 
http://132.68.52.118/ip-noise/



Always Accept:
--------------

ncftp ftp
cd /pub/Linux/RedHat-7.1/RedHat/RPMS/
get kernel-source-[TAB]
quit

Non-Stable Delay:
-----------------

Explain what is the UDP test. - delay U(0,5000)

On comnet17/18 run "perl client.pl 20000 1000".

Stable Delay:
-------------

Wait for all the packets to be released. - delay U(0,3000)

On comnet17/18 run "perl client.pl 20000 1000".

Block TCP:
----------

On comnet17/18 type: "ping -s 132.68.52.118 50"

Reload netscape to show that TCP does not work.

Block ICMP:
---------

On comnet17/18 type: "ping -s 132.68.52.118 50"

Reload netscape to show that TCP works.

Block HTTP:
------------

Reload netscape to show that TCP works.
Run perl test.pl 20000 1000
/usr/local/bin/ssh project@132.68.52.118.

Complete Scenario:
------------------

1. On one of the vipe terminals run "ping -s 150 132.68.52.118".
    noisy delay=3sec

2. On the second one, run "ping -s 50 132.68.52.118"  - noisy drop=1

3. On t2, run ping -s 132.68.52.118. - noisy drop=1
