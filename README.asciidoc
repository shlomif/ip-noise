Introduction
------------

This is an open source TCP/IP noise simulator for Linux-based
systems using https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netfilter[Netfilter's]
ipqueue mechanism. It delays or drops IP packets based on
predefined rules.

This project was originally done as a Technion project by
https://www.shlomifish.org/[Shlomi Fish] and Roy Glasberg.

Fish and Glasberg have placed their modifications and new code under
the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License[MIT / Expat licence]
but some of it is based on FOSS code under different licences.
