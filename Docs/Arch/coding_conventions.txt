Arbitrator:
===========

Identifiers:
------------

We used lowercase names for all of our identifiers. The words or 
components are separated by underscores. 

All exportable symbols start with "ip_noise" in order to avoid 
namespace collition. Folliwing the ip_noise comes the class name.
E.g: "rand", "arbitrator_iface", "delayer" Etc. The last component
is the name of the method.

Most classes have an alloc method that allocates a new object, and
a destroy method that destroys it. 

Typedefs:
---------

Typedefs also start with ip_noise, but end with a "_t" suffix. They
are usually declared as "struct ip_noise_foo_struct" where foo is the
data type being declared.
