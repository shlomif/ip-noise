<h1>The IP-Noise Simulator Users' Guide</h1>
</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is the IP-Noise Simulator</h3>

<p>
The IP-Noise Simulator is a simulator for TCP/IP networks noise that can run
on top of a Linux 2.4.x system. It is available in two versions: one as a 
stand-alone user-level program that can run from the command line. The second 
one is a kernel module, that should be loaded with <tt>insmod</tt>.
</p>

<p>
TCP/IP noise generation involves the deliberate dropping or delaying of 
packets sent over the TCP/IP network. The simulator can distinguish between the
various protocols above the IP level and arbitrate them differently 
accordingly. However, the contents of the packets cannot affect its decision
in any way.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is assumed that the network congestion is independent of what
occurs in the applications that are tested with the noise. Thus, the load
of the network does not affect the simulator's behaviour.
</p>

<h3>When can it prove useful?</h3>

<p>
We intend the simulator to be used to test the robustness of protocols, and
see how immune they are to network noise. The simulator is designed to be 
flexible and simulate various network noise conditions, in a manner that is 
accurate enough for most needs.
</p>

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>
The project was initiated by Lavy Libman, and was written by Shlomi Fish
and Roy Glasberg under his supervision. It was conducted with the help and
resources of the 
<a href="http://comnet.technion.ac.il/">Computer Networks Lab</a> 
of <a href="http://www.technion.ac.il/">The Technion</a>.
</p>

<p>
We would like to thank the various people in the 
<a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/">Israeli Group of Linux Users</a> who provided
important help and input during the various stages of the project: Omer Mussaev,
Guy Keren, Mulix and others. We would also like to thank the developers of the 
<a href="http://netfilter.samba.org/">Netfilter</a> firewalling stack of the 
Linux Kernel 2.4, which gave us most of the necessary kernel functionality,
and made our work much easier.
</p>

<p>
We would also like to thank the FOKUS group for creating and maintaining the 
<a href="http://developer.berlios.de/">BerliOS</a> service, whose on-line 
resources we were able to use.
</p>

<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>

<p>
The simulator requires a GNU/Linux system running the Linux Kernel version 
2.4.x. IP-Tables has to be available as a kernel module, as is the 
IP-Queue module.
</p>

<h3>License</h3>

<p>
The translator which is written in Perl is distributed under the MIT X11 
license. The compiler is distributed under a dual GPL and MIT X11 license except for the following modules:
</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li>
<tt>redblack.c</tt> - derived work which is distributed under the LGPL. (part of the 
<a href="http://libredblack.sourceforge.net/">libredblack</a> distribution)
</li>

<li>
<tt>ip_queue.c</tt> - derived work which is distributed under the GPL. (was derived from
the module of the same name of the Linux 2.4.x kernel.)
</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>
The Perl arbitrator is no longer maintained and is only useful as a reference
implementation. We cannot guarantee that it does not contain bugs. It is 
distributed under the MIT X11 license.
</p>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>

<h3>Global Instructions</h3>

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<p>
In order to use the simulator, the IP-Tables kernel module must be compiled,
and available for loading. Specifically, the ip_queue module should be 
available. perl v. 5.6.1 or later must be available on the 
system in order to configure the simulator.
</p>

<p>
libipq which is part of the iptables userland distribution should be installed 
and available on the system, as the userland simulator makes use of it.
</p>

<h4>Compiling the Simulator</h4>

<p>
Download and unpack the latest distribution. <tt>cd</tt> to the directory 
<tt>C/arbitrator</tt>. In order to compile the userland simulator type 
"<tt>make</tt>". 
</p>

<p>
In order to compile the kernel module-based simulator type 
"<tt>make -f Makefile kernel</tt>". In case you don't have 
an i386-compatible machine, you should edit the file 
<tt>Makefile.kernel</tt> and change the line "<tt>I386 = 1</tt>" 
to "<tt>I386 = 0</tt>".
</p>

<h3>Userland Arbitrator Specific Instructions</h3>

<p>
Designate a directory in which two named pipes will be put. These pipes will
be used for communication between the arbitrator and the configuration
utility. The directory should be accessible both by root and by the user, with
which you intend to run the configurator (which we recommend 
should not be root).
</p>

<p>
In this directory type the following set of commands as root:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# pwd
/ip-noise
#mkfifo to_arb
#mkfifo from_arb
#chown ipnoise.ipnoise to_arb from_arb
#chmod 600 to_arb from_arb
#chmod 700 .
#chown ipnoise.ipnoise .
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<tt>ipnoise.ipnoise</tt> is the user-name and group of the user that will 
be used to invoke the configurator. Now set the environment variable 
<tt>IP_NOISE_UM_ARB_CONN_PATH</tt> to the full path of this directory in the
initial shell scripts of both root and the <tt>ipnoise</tt> user.
</p>

<h3>Kernel-module Arbitrator Specific Instructions</h3>

<p>
Under the home directory of the user which will run the module, type the 
following commands as root: 
</p>

<p>
<pre>
# mknod iface_dev c 254 0
# chown ipnoise.ipnoise iface_dev
# chmod 600 iface_dev
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<tt>ipnoise.ipnoise</tt> is the user-name and group of the user which will run
the configuration utility.
</p>

<h2>Running the Arbitrator</h2>

<h3>Setting up IP-Tables Rules to Transfer Packets for Noisifying</h3>

<p>
The simulator intercepts packets from the kernel by means of the IP-Tables
framework. It receives those packets (and only those packets) that were 
designated with the <tt>QUEUE</tt> rule. Normally, you would like to configure
the IP-Tables rules, so that important communication will not be interfered 
with. Only the ports, protocols and IPs of interest need to be transferred
to the arbitrator in order to decide their verdict.
</p>

<p>
Describing how to set up IP-Tables rules is out of the scope of this article. 
We refer you to the Internet for further information. However, we will present 
a script that we use to set up the IP-Tables rules on our Mandrake Linux 8.1 
system:

Note that the IP-Noise kernel module replaces the IP-Queue mechanism of the 
Linux kernel, and both cannot be used simultaneously.
</p>

<h3>Loading and Unloading the arbitrator</h3>

<h4>Userland Arbitrator</h4>

<p>
After the IP-Table rules has been set up follow the following steps:
</p>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
<tt>modprobe ip_queue</tt>
</li>
<li>
As root, cd to the <tt>C/arbitrator</tt> directory of the distribution. 
There type <tt>./arb</tt> to invoke the arbitrator.
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
To unload it, simply type <tt>Ctrl+C</tt> at the terminal in which it 
was invoked.
</p>

<h4>Kernel-Module Arbitrator</h4>

<p>
After the IP-Tables rules have been set up, cd to the <tt>C/arbitrator</tt> 
directory of the distribution as root. There type <tt>insmod ./ip-noise-arb.o</tt>.
</p>

<p>
To unload it type <tt>rmmod ip-noise-arb</tt> as root.
</p>

<h3>Configuring an Arbitrator</h3>

<p>
To configure an arbitrator one has to prepare a configuration file that
contains the description of the noise behaviour, in the syntax that was
defined for this purpose (which will be described below). After the file has
been prepared, cd to the <tt>perl/compiler</tt> 
directory of the distribution. Then type <tt>perl tests/translator.pl</tt>
or <tt>perl tests/ker_translator.pl</tt> (for the userland and kernel-level 
arbitrators respectively) followed by the path of the configuration file.
</p>

<h2>Configuration of the Arbitrator - Basic Concepts</h2>

<h3>Markov Chains</h3>

<p>
Markov chains are similar in concept to state machines, except that the next
state is determined according to a probability factor rather than the input to
the state machine. In each iteration, a probability value between 0 and 1 is
determined randomly (and uniformly) and based on it, the next state is deduced.
</p>

<p>
The following figure, displays a sample Markov chain:
</p>

<p>
<img src="markov_chain1.png" alt="First Markov Chain">
</p>

<p>
As can be seen, after an iteration step, "A" switches to itself with a 
probabilty of 0.5, and to "B" with a probability of 0.5. "B" and "C" switch
to themselves and to one another with a various probabilities. One can notice,
that once the chain leaves "A", it cannot return to it again.
</p>

<p>
The sum of the probabilities of the links that emerge out of a certain state
must be equal to 1, so the chain will always know to which state to go to next. 
In our implementation of Markov chains, we assumed that in case, the 
sum of emerging probabilities is less than 1, than the remainder instructs the
chain to remain in the current state. If the sum of probabilites is greater
than 1, a compilation-time error will be reported.
</p>

<p>
One can model memory-less noise using a Markov chain, in which each state
dictates a different statistical behaviour of the noise.
</p>

<h3>Basic Concepts</h3>

<h4>Delay</h4>

<p>
A packet can be delayed by a certain amount of milliseconds. This delay 
can be determined randomly, by specifiying a certain type of statistical
distribution or another.
</p>

<h4>Drop</h4>

<p>
One can specify to drop the packet altogether representing a loss of a packet
along its route.
</p>

<h4>Accept</h4>

<p>
One can specify to simply "accept" the packet and send it on its way. For 
all practical purposes, an accept is treated as a delay of 0.
</p>

<h4>Exponential Delay</h4>

<p>
An exponential delay is a distribution of a delay according to the formula
F(t)=1-e<sup>-&lambda;t</sup>. The lambda factor can be determined by the 
user.
</p>

<h4>Generic Delay (or Split-Linear Delay)</h4>

<p>
This is a generic delay type that can be used to model an arbitrarily complex
delay function. In it one specifies points along the randomosity factor from 0 
to 1. For each such point, one specifies the delay at that point. Between
two adjacent points, one interpolates their end-values linearily.
</p>

<h4>Uniform Delay</h4>

<p>
In this delay type, the delay is chosen uniformly between a minimum and a 
maximum specified by the user.
</p>

<h4>Stable Delay</h4>

<p>
A delay can be either stable or non-stable. In a stable delay, the packets 
are sent on their way at the same order in which they arrived.
In a non-stable delay, their order may be mixed. One can decide whether
to issue a stable or non-stable delay by specifiying a probability factor.
</p>

<h3>How the Arbitration is Done</h3>

<h4>Several Markov Chains</h4>

<p>
The arbitrator contains several markov chains which are run and processed in 
parallel. Each chain has a chain filter that specifies which packets it wishes
to process. When a packet arrives at the arbitrator, it is passed to all the
chains, except for a special chain which is designated as the default chain. 
Each chain determines on its own what to do with the packet, without consulting
the other chains.
</p>

<p>
A packet that is not processed by any chain is passed to the default chain, 
whose filter (if any) is ignored. If more than one chain processed the packet, 
then the following rules apply:
</p>

<p>
<b>1.</b> If the packet was dropped by any chain, then it will be dropped. 
(i.e: each chain can veto the verdict to a drop)
</p>

<p>
<b>2.</b> If none of the chains dropped it, then the delay the packet would
experience would be the sum of the delays of the chains. 
(and as previously mentioned, an accept verdict is considered as a 
delay of length 0)
</p>

<h4>State Switching</h4>

<p>
In each chain, the states are switched at exponential times from the time of 
the last switch. Each state determines the probabilities for a packet being 
dropped, delayed or accepted and the distribution of the delay. It also 
determines the probability for a stable delay.
</p>

<h4>Chain Filters</h4>

<p>
A chain filter determines which packets are processed by a chain according to 
their TCP/IP information. The motivation for a chain filter is that different
parts of the network being modelled may experience different conditions. 
Therefore, packets need to be treated differently based on their destination,
source and other TCP/IP properties.
</p>

<p>
In the IP-Noise Simulator, packets can be filtered according to the following 
factors:
</p>

<p>
<ol>

<li>
Source IPs and port combinations.
</li>

<li>
Destination IPs and port combinations.
</li>

<li>
Packet Length
</li>

<li>
Value of the Time of Service field
</li>

<li>
The Protocol type above the IP layer (e.g: TCP, UDP, ICMP, OSPF and IGMP).
</li>

</ol>
</p>

<h2>The Configuration File Syntax</h2>

<h3>General Conventions</h3>

<p>
Empty lines are ignored. Comments start with the sharp-sign (<tt>#</tt>) and
extend until the end of the line.
</p>

<p>
Identifiers contain letters, underscores and digits, where 
the first character is not a digit. Identifier are not case-sensitive. 
</p>

<p>
Block constructs are declared at one line, in which a left curly bracket 
(<tt>{</tt>), must appear, and after it, nothing elese. They span several 
lines, until they are terminated with a right curly bracket (<tt>}</tt>)
on its own line.
</p>

<p>
Blocks contain field names followed by an equal sign (<tt>=</tt>) followed
by a value. All of which must appear on the same line.
</p>

<h3>Syntax of a State</h3>

<p>
A state starts with the <tt>State</tt> keyword, followed by the state name
followed by a left curly bracket (<tt>{</tt>). The state name is an 
identifier.</p>

<p>
The <tt>State</tt> keyword, the name and the <tt>{</tt> must all appear on 
the same line. A state ends with a right curly bracket (<tt>}</tt>) 
which appears on a line of its own.
</p>

<h4>drop, and delay probs</h4>

<p>
If a <tt>drop</tt> or <tt>delay</tt> field/value pair appears it specifies
the probability in which a packet will be dropped or delayed when the
chain is at this state. The values of <tt>drop</tt> and <tt>delay</tt> will
be assumed to be 0 if not specified, and the rest of the probability will
be assumed to send the packet as is.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
State MyState {
    drop = 0.2
    delay = 0.3
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This state drops packets with a probability of 0.2 and delays them with 
a probability of 0.3
</p>

<h4>time_factor</h4>

<p>
The <tt>time_factor</tt> field specifies the time factor (in milliseconds)
of the state. This will be supplied as input to an exponential delay 
calculation that will determine the time the state is switched.
</p>

<h4>move_to's</h4>

<p>
The <tt>move_to</tt> field specifies the probabilities the state will switch
to other states. After a state is switched, the next state is determined 
according to a random value.
</p>

<p>
The syntax is <tt>move_to = {</tt> at the first line followed by a list of 
<tt>[Probability] = [State]</tt> lines followed by a line containing a right
curly bracket (<tt>}</tt>). If the probabilities sum below 1, the 
remainder will be assumed to remain in the current state.
</p>

<p>
Here's an example:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
State MyState {
    drop = 0.2
    delay = 0.1
    time_factor = 500
    move_to = {
        0.2 = AnotherState
        0.1 = StateWithoutAName
    }
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
This state switched to <tt>AnotherState</tt> with a probability of 0.2,
and to <tt>StateWithoutAName</tt> with a probability of 0.1, and remains
at itself with a probability of 0.7.
</p>

<h4>delay_type</h4>

<p>
The <tt>delay_type</tt> field specifies the type of the delay. Its value can be
any of the following:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
Exponential: With a given factor in milliseconds. 
Marking: <tt>E([factor])</tt>. For example: <tt>E(500)</tt>, or <tt>E(10)</tt>.
</li>

<li>
Uniform: Marking: <tt>U([start],[end])</tt>. For example: <tt>U(100,500)</tt>.
</li>

<li>
<p>
Generic: This defines a function from 0 to 1 using intermediate points. 
The value field should start with <tt>Generic {</tt> and end with 
a line containing a right curly bracket (<tt>}</tt>). Between them, there are
<tt>[prob] = [delay]</tt> lines. Note that 0 to 1 will be chosen within the
probability range allocated for delaying a packet. 
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
delay_type = Generic {
    0 = 500
    0.1 = 500
    0.2 = 300
    0.5 = 0
    0.8 = 0
    0.8001 = 1000
    1      = 2000
}
</pre>
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4>stable_delay</h4>

<p>
The <tt>stable_delay</tt> field specifies the stable delay probability of
the state.
</p>

<h4>Complete State Example:</h4>

<p>
<pre>
State A {
   drop = 0.2
   delay = 0.1
   delay_type = E(200)
   time_factor = 500 # This is the time factor to move to the other state
   stable_delay = 0.2  # This is the probability for a stable delay.
   move_to = {
        0.2 = B
        0.3 = C
        0.5 = E
   }    
}
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Chain Syntax</h3>

<p>
A chain starts with the keyword <tt>Chain</tt> followed by the chain's
identifier followed by a left curly bracket (<tt>{</tt>) - all on the
same line. It is terminated with a right curly bracket on a line of its
own (<tt>}</tt>).
</p>

<h4>States</h4>

<p>
A chain can contain an arbitrary number of states, that are specified using
the state syntax. There is one special state which ought to be named 
<tt>Start</tt>, which is the initial state of the chain.
</p>

<h4>The Chain Filter</h4>

<h5>length</h5>

<p>
The length field specifies the length of the IP packets that is accepted
by the chain. Its syntax is <tt>length = l &lt; [max_len] </tt>, or
<tt>length = l &gt; [min_len]</tt> or 
<tt>length = [min_len] &lt; l &lt; [max_len]</tt>.
</p>

<h5>tos</h5>

<p>
The <tt>tos</tt> field specifies a valid range for the Time-of-service 
specifier. The syntax is similar to the <tt>length</tt> field except that 
the variable <tt>tos</tt> is used instead of <tt>l</tt>. For example:
<tt>tos = tos &gt; 30</tt> or <tt>tos = 2 &lt; tos &lt; 5</tt>.
</p>

<h5>dest and source</h5>

<p>
<tt>source</tt> specifies a list of IP addresses and their corresponding ports
for the source of packets to be processed by the chain. <tt>dest</tt> is the 
same only for the destination of the packets.
</p>

<p>
The value of these fields is a semicolon delimited list of IP specifications.
An IP specification contains an IP address (4 decimal digits separated by a 
dot (<tt>.</tt>)); an optional netmask width preceded by a slash (<tt>/</tt>).
The last part is an optional port specifier that begins with a colon 
(<tt>:</tt>) and contains a comma-delimited list of port ranges or individual
port numbers. A port range is of the form <tt>[start_port]-[end_port]</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Note: if the protocol above the IP does not use ports, then the port 
specification will be ignored.
</p>

<p>
Examples:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
source = 127.0.0.1:80                 # Only HTTP from the localhost
source = 10.0.0.0/24:80,8080          # Only HTTP and 8080 from 10.x.x.x
dest = 132.69.253.254 ; 132.68.7.4    # Either of the two IP addresses.
</pre>
</p>

<h5>protocol</h5>

<p>
The protocol specifies the protocols above IP that will be accepted by
the chain. Each can be a numeric value or it can be a name of the protocol 
(according to the file /etc/protocols). The indiviuals protocols are separated
by a comma.
</p>

<p>
Example:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
protocol = tcp, udp
</pre>
</p>

<h4>Complete Arbitrator Example</h4>

<p>
<pre>

# This is the chain which handles packets which were not accepted
# in any of the other chains.
Chain Default {
    State A { 
        time_factor = 100000
    }
}

Chain vipe_len_lt_100 {
    State Start {
        time_factor = 5000
        drop = 0
        move_to = {
            0.5 = Noisy
        }
    }
    State Noisy {

<h2>Final Notes</h2>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>

<p>
<ol>
<li>
The kernel module arbitrator does not work with the new virtual memory manager
by Andrea Archangeli. We are inspecting what can be done to change the 
situation.
</li>
<li>
It is possible for a malicious compiler that communicates with the kernel 
module to cause the kernel to crash by having it allocate a lot of memory.
</li>
</ol>
