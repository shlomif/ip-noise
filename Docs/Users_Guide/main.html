<h1>The IP-Noise Simulator Users' Guide</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>What is the IP-Noise Simulator</h3>

<p>
The IP-Noise Simulator is a simulator for TCP/IP networks noise that can run
on top of a Linux 2.4.x system. It is available in two versions: one as a 
standalone user-level program that can run from the command line. The second 
one is a kernel module, that should be loaded with <tt>insmod</tt>.
</p>

<p>
TCP/IP noise generation involves the deliberate dropping or delaying of 
packets sent over the TCP/IP network. The simulator can distinguish between the
various protocols above the IP level and arbitrate them differently 
accordingly. However, the contents of the packets cannot affect its decision
in any way.
</p>

<p>
Note that it is assumed that the network congestion is independant of what
occurs in the applications that are tested with the noise. Thus, the load
of the network does not affect the simulator's behaviour.
</p>

<h3>When can it prove useful?</h3>

<p>
We intend the simulator to be used to test the robustness of protocols, and
see how immune they are to network noise. The simulator is designed to be 
flexible and simulate various network noise conditions, in a manner that is 
accurate enough for most needs.

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>
The project was initiated by Lavy Libman, and was written by Shlomi Fish
and Roy Glasberg under his supervision. It was conducted with the help and
resources of the 
<a href="http://comnet.technion.ac.il/">Computer Networks Lab</a> 
of <a href="http://www.technion.ac.il/">The Technion</a>.
</p>

<p>
We would like to thank the various people in the 
<a href="http://www.iglu.org.il/">Israeli Group of Linux Users</a> who provided
important help and input during the varios stages of the project: Omer Mussaev,
Guy Keren, Mulix and others. We would also like to thank the developers of the 
<a href="http://netfilter.samba.org/">Netfilter</a> firewalling stack of the 
Linux Kernel 2.4, which gave us most of the necessary kernel functionality,
and made our work much easier.
</p>

<h3>Supported Platforms</h3>

<p>
The simulator requires a GNU/Linux system running the Linux Kernel version 
2.4.x. IP-Tables has to be available as a kernel module, as is the 
IP-Queue module.

the module of the same name of the Linux 2.4.x kernel.)

The Perl arbitrator is no longer maintained and is only useful as a reference
implementation. We cannot guarantee that it does not contain bugs. It is
