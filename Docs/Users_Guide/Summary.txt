* Introduction
    - What is IP-Noise Simulator?
    - When can it be useful?
    - Credits
    - Supported platforms

* Installation Instructions
    - Global
    - For the user-land arbitrator
    - For the kernel-land arbitrator

* Setting up a noise source
    - IP-Tables and IP-Queue
    - Loading and unloading the arbitrator
    - Configuring the arbitrator using translator.pl or ker_translator.pl.

* The configuration of the arbitrator - basic concepts
    - Markov Chains
    - Basic concepts: delay, drop, exponential delay, split-linear delay, etc.
    - How the arbitration is done
        - Several Markov chains
            - Totalling the decision 
        - States are switched at exponential steps
        - Stable Delays        
        - Chain Filters

* The configuration file syntax
    - State Syntax
        - move_to's
        - time_factor
        - drop, delay probs
        - stable_delay prob
    - Chain Syntax
        - States
            - The default state
        - Filters
            - length
            - dest & source
                - IPs
                - Netmasks
                - ports
            - tos
            - protocol
            
        - The default chain.
