Tools we used:
==============

VNC:
----

VNC, which stands for "Virtual Networking Computer" is similar to remote X.
However, it has two very big advantages:

1. It retains the same session between two consecutive logins.
2. Its Win32 viewer is only one file, and does not require adminstrator
permissions to run.

During our first days, when we were given a very crammy screen, we set up a 
VNC server on our Linux workstation, a viewer on a Windows 2000 machine, and 
used the Linux workstation over the network.

It usually worked very well. VNC is not without its flaws, however. 
For instance, using a tiled-image wallpaper, resulted in a very slow rendering
of the screen for some reason.

Perl:
-----

Perl is a programming language commonly used for writing server-side Web 
applications and for many other system administartion tasks. We found it 
useful to program both the compiler and the initial version of the arbitrator
in Perl, because a perl code takes a fraction of time to write in comparison
to the equivalent C code.
