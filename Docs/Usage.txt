Instructions for the User-Mode Arbitrator:
------------------------------------------

1. Unpack the arbitrator and compile it by typing "make". (you may need to
install libipq and its headers before that)

2. Unpack the compiler (it is written in Perl so it does not need compilation).
The compiler need not be run as root.

3. Create two named pipes - "from_arb" and "to_arb" in a certain directory.
Note: the user that runs the compiler should be able to read and write to them.

4. Set the environment variable IP_NOISE_UM_ARB_CONN_PATH to the full path
of that directory. This variable should be set in the shells of both the 
superuser and the user that will run the compiler.

5. Load the ip_queue module: "modprobe ip_queue".

6. Set certain firewall rules to have the "QUEUE" directive. Like this:
# /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j QUEUE

The packets that are filtered by this rule will be passed to the 
arbitrator. You may wish to make sure that some traffic will not be passed
to it, by playing with the firewalling rules.

7. Enter the arbitrator's directory, su into root, and run the arbitrator.

8. Prepare a file containing the configuration of the arbitrator. 

9. Enter the compiler's directory and type "./translator.pl [path_to_myfile]"
where [path_to_myfile] is the path to the file that contains the configuration.

10. You can later reload the arbitrator with different configurations by
using steps #8 and #9.

Instructions for the Kernel Arbitrator:
---------------------------------------

1. Unpack the arbitrator and compile it by typing "make -f Makefile.kernel".

2. Unpack the compiler (it is written in Perl so it does not need compilation).
The compiler need not be run as root.

3. Create a device file by typing "mknod iface_dev c 254 0". Note that the 
user that will run the compiler need to be able to read and write from it.

4. Set the environment variable IP_NOISE_KER_ARB_CONN_PATH to the full path
of this device in the shell of the user that would run the compiler.

5. Load the IP-Tables module: "modprobe ip_tables".

6. Set certain firewall rules to have the "QUEUE" directive. Like this:
# /sbin/iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j QUEUE

7. Enter the arbitrator's directory, su into root and type 
"/sbin/insmod ip-noise-arb.o".

8. Prepare a file containing the configuration of the arbitrator. 

9. Enter the compiler's directory and type 
"./ker_translator.pl [path_to_myfile]" where [path_to_myfile] is the 
path to the file that contains the configuration.

10. You can later reload the arbitrator with different configurations by
using steps #8 and #9.
